# Next.js Page Router

Next.js Page Router is the built-in routing system that automatically turns files in the `pages` directory into routes for your web application. It's a powerful and intuitive way to manage static and dynamic routes, create nested pages, and build backend API endpoints in a single framework.

## Features

- **Automatic Routing**: Files in the `pages` directory become routes automatically.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Create routes with dynamic parameters using square brackets (`[param]`).
- **API Routes**: Define backend API endpoints within the `pages/api` directory.
- **Nested Routes**: Organize your application with nested routes for better structure.
- **SSR and SSG**: Leverage server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) seamlessly.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Next.js Page Router, create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app
cd my-app
```
